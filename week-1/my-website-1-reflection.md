#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a reopository on git hub is very easy! Login into git hub and click new the "+" in the top right tabs. Follow the steps to name, describe and make the repository. After the Repositry is made, a HTTPS url will be available to copy to the the bottom right. Open the command terminal and paste the Url into the proper Folder. You will now have a copy of the master branch saved on your computer. 

#Describe what open source means.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? 

I find open code source to be a very cool and excited aspect of Software development. Its is a great refrence and tool for people like myself to see the actual code and how it works. It does feel like a utopia, an area where everyone uploads their own projects and ideas and people can play and edit to thier hearts desire


#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses in open source are necessary for protection of your softwares copyrights and to make parameters on allowing others to download, distribute or even sell modified software. Having licenses is a very smart thing to add to open source code for protection and outlines of copyrights. 


#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

In this challenge I really locked in the stages of commits and pushing to the master branch. I solidified these stages with my own mistakes and having to make more branches and edits than planned.
