##What does puts do?

puts is a Command that evaluates ruby code. puts adds a
new line after it executes the code. 


##What is an integer? What is a float?

An interger is a whole number. If used in an arithmetic 
function it will round down to a whole number.floats are numbers with a decimal place. 

##What is the difference between float and integer 
division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? called floating-point numbers 

Interger and float in division will give back different solutions. Integer division will give nack a whole number the is wrounded to the nearest integer. Floats stand for "floating-point numbers" and will give back an exact decimal point. Floats should be used for preicse and scientific calculations. 



```ruby
puts 365*24
puts (365*10)*(24*60)

```

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby executes subtration, multiplication, addition like a calculator would with the excpetion on division. If the number is a interger or a float it will give different solutions.


##What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a whole number.A float is a number with a decimal value. Float stand for "floating-point numbers" 


##What is the difference between integer and float division? 

Integer division will give back a rounded whole number and float division will give back the decimal.


##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are objects the ruby can manipulate. They are in quotes and usaully represented be characters. 


##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them? 

A local variable is something you define. You use them in place of typing out what you want. You can manipulate local variables in ruby.


##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

The challenge was definietly a refresher on ruby. I was doing too much at first and trying to make methods when none were neccesary. The only hard part I ran into was making "modulus" work. Overall fun challenge.
