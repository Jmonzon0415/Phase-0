	<h1>Summary</h1>
	  <p>Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
		learn how to dissect an HTML page from the head to the footer, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!</p>

  <h1>Release 0: Set up</h1>

     <p>Before you can get started, you'll need to get setup for the challenge. Decide who is going to drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:<p>

   <ul> 
    <li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
    <li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
    <li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
    <li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
    <li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like:<a href="https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html</a></li>

   </ul>
    <p> NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles half way through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple google doc).</p>

#What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  Some HTML5 semantics I have used in this Challenge are header,article,section,nav and footer. These Are HTML5 tag I euse the most because it easily allows me to understand what Im am using that tag for.   



#How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
      The body and footer are showed and layed out in the page. Also the title inside the head maybe visable in the browser tab. The browser shows the standard order of the an HTML document. 



#What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Sublime has pre made templates which are very nice and saves time. I will be creating more handy snippits to streamlime my html and css properties.
