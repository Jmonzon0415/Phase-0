 *Position Static* is a property that positions the element in the normal flow of the page.
 It is not affected by top, bottom, left and right properties. 

*Position Relative* is a property that posistions the element using top,right,bottom and left to move it away from its normal position. 

*Postion Fixed* is a property that posistions the element fixed, so when you scroll it stays  on the page within view 


*Posistion Absolute* is a property that is relative to its parent.  If it has now parents it move like fixed .

The padding is the distance between the content and border, padding is transparent. The border goes around the padding and content and will have properties of color and line types. Margin is transparent and encompasses everthing.




#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
