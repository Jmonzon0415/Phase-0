# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input? A positive interger 
# What is the output? A interger seperated by the properly placed commas.
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# define method seperate commas
# If integer is less than 1000 no comma needed
# turn integer to string 
# get length of string
# Place a comma every 3 characters starting from the right.
# return string with commas 

# 1. Initial Solution

def seperate_comma(integer)
	if integer < 1000 
	  return integer
	elsif integer >= 1000
	 string = interger.to_s.length
	  
end
end

puts seperate_comma(2000)
